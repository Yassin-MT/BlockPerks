Distributing vouchers, for employees, which are valid at participating merchants. 

Companies use vouchers  to motivate their employees to access services, or buy goods provided by Registered Service Providers, called merchants. Vouchers are issued in the name of the applicant company (the Recipient), have no cash value and are non-transferable; they are only payable to the selected Registered Service.

The number of vouchers issued are always backed by a stable equivalent value of crypto in order to offer transparency and guarantee the value of the vouchers.
